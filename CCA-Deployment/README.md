If you need to rename the machine, do that FIRST and reboot--the script will use the default hostname and autojoin to a domain if you dont.

Copy the entire 'CCA-Deployment' folder to C:\

Run deploy.bat AS AN ADMINISTRATOR....

If there are any problems, try to run the script a second time. If that doesnt work, suck it.
