go 100% on running from a flash drive

Prepare with offline cache of frequently used scripts.

the thing ultimately does need to download copies of everyting it interacts with on github to a well-structured matrix of folders for situations where there is no internet.

executing the batch should immediately build out the basic folder structure.

the script must default to an offline mode when there is not an internet connection available. offline mode causes the script to failover and derive its menu items based upon the contents of the existing usb folder structure

the script must build out a folder structure on the usb--while online--that would be identical to the most recent folder structure on github.

the folder structure must remain persistant across continuous script runs. it must never delete folders. universal installers must go to the root\installers folder. 

all script activity must favor fresh retrevial from github and failover to local copies when its offline

the script must utilize github api functionality when online

persistant status indicators on main page for passed/failed environmental checks

4 columns for dual status/variable columns above menu
---running in ps7?
---online?
---admin?
---live ram usage
---live 

add items to the menu based solely on what is detected in github or local

add generic functionality to the menu for more advanced needs
-such as instant vpn only for a specific company
-universal sophos
-universal vsa
-universal acronis
-option to list detected networked printers in a menu to select/install

position menu differently and static highlighting. scrolling the menu should scroll the menu items to account for length. submenus should switch to static menu entries with moving highlight/selection bar

eliminate mainmenu.txt and derive menu structure, banner, motd, and main.ps1 from existing github folder structure, failing over to local folder structure when offline

make a new launcher that downloads a manifest to update all primary script components before launching main.bat

every company folder needs to have: submenu, manifest if onboarding, sophos ID, 

the script should make and keep one current hashfile locally in the relevant company for every file it downloads so that it can check for updated versions later

immediately after downloading files which are newer than the ones stored locally, the script should notify that a new version has become available
